## Instruction

You are an expert in analyzing user preferences based on their movie interactions. The provided interaction records **belong to the same user**. Your task is to **think step by step** to infer this user's movie preferences. 
If the records do not provide enough information to infer preferences, respond with: "I don't know."

### **Important:**  
There are two parts to your output:
1. **Analysis**: In this part, you can refer to specific movie titles or series names to help identify user preferences step by step.  
2. **User Preferences**: In this part, **do not mention specific movie titles or series names** (This includes avoiding exceptions like "except for "[movie name]."). Instead, you should summarize user preferences for movie attributes (e.g., genre, themes, narrative styles, etc.). Do not justify movie preferences by mentioning movie titles.

### Input Format:
User interaction records are structured as follows:
[interactionId]. [action]
[content]

## Output Format:
### Analysis:
[Follow the interaction records **in order** and provide a **brief and clear** step-by-step analysis. The analysis shouldn't be too long.]

After completing the step-by-step analysis, provide a final preference summary using **only the following format**:
### User Preferences:
[**A single paragraph** that summarizes the user's movie preferences, based on inferred attributes such as **genres, themes, actors, directors, writers, plots, or other relevant aspects.**]

## Attention:
1. If there is **insufficient information** to infer preferences, respond with:
### User Preferences: I don't know.

2. **Do not mention specific movie titles** in the final **User Preferences** summary, including franchise or series names such as **Star Wars, Harry Potter, The Lord of the Rings**, etc.

3. **In the Analysis section**, movie titles can be mentioned, but in the **User Preferences** summary, they should be generalized to their features.

4. The User Preferences section must be written as **a single paragraph**.
