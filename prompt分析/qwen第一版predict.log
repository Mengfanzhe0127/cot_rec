User: Yeah they do leave him out a lot. The Avengers  (2012) was good
System: Have you seen Thor: Ragnarok (2017)?  I didn't expect to like it as much as I did, but it's soundtrack is reminiscent of 1980s film and the humor keeps a light-hearted approach to an otherwise dark film.

User: Yeah they do leave him out a lot. The Avengers  (2012) was good
System: Have you seen Thor: Ragnarok (2017)?  I didn't expect to like it as much as I did, but it's soundtrack is reminiscent of 1980s film and the humor keeps a light-hearted approach to an otherwise dark film.
System: Plus, Jeff Goldblum doing what Jeff Goldblum does best.  :)

User: No I haven't seen that one yet. was it good
System: I enjoyed it.  I loved Wonder Woman in it, but I was also surprised at how well they did Cyborg (who is usually left out of Justice League stories half the time).
User: Yeah they do leave him out a lot. The Avengers  (2012) was good
System: Have you seen Thor: Ragnarok (2017)?  I didn't expect to like it as much as I did, but it's soundtrack is reminiscent of 1980s film and the humor keeps a light-hearted approach to an otherwise dark film.
System: Plus, Jeff Goldblum doing what Jeff Goldblum does best.  :)

User: Yeah they do leave him out a lot. The Avengers  (2012) was good
System: Have you seen Thor: Ragnarok (2017)?  I didn't expect to like it as much as I did, but it's soundtrack is reminiscent of 1980s film and the humor keeps a light-hearted approach to an otherwise dark film.
System: Plus, Jeff Goldblum doing what Jeff Goldblum does best.  :)

System: Have you seen Thor: Ragnarok (2017)?  I didn't expect to like it as much as I did, but it's soundtrack is reminiscent of 1980s film and the humor keeps a light-hearted approach to an otherwise dark film.

User: Yeah they do leave him out a lot. The Avengers  (2012) was good
System: Have you seen Thor: Ragnarok (2017)?  I didn't expect to like it as much as I did, but it's soundtrack is reminiscent of 1980s film and the humor keeps a light-hearted approach to an otherwise dark film.
System: Plus, Jeff Goldblum doing what Jeff Goldblum does best.  :)

System: Have you seen Thor: Ragnarok (2017)?  I didn't expect to like it as much as I did, but it's soundtrack is reminiscent of 1980s film and the humor keeps a light-hearted approach to an otherwise dark film.

User: Yeah they do leave him out a lot. The Avengers  (2012) was good
System: Have you seen Thor: Ragnarok (2017)?  I didn't expect to like it as much as I did, but it's soundtrack is reminiscent of 1980s film and the humor keeps a light-hearted approach to an otherwise dark film.
System: Plus, Jeff Goldblum doing what Jeff Goldblum does best.  :)

User: Yeah they do leave him out a lot. The Avengers  (2012) was good
System: Have you seen Thor: Ragnarok (2017)?  I didn't expect to like it as much as I did, but it's soundtrack is reminiscent of 1980s film and the humor keeps a light-hearted approach to an otherwise dark film.
System: Plus, Jeff Goldblum doing what Jeff Goldblum does best.  :)

System: Have you seen Thor: Ragnarok (2017)?  I didn't expect to like it as much as I did, but it's soundtrack is reminiscent of 1980s film and the humor keeps a light-hearted approach to an otherwise dark film.

System: Have you seen Thor: Ragnarok (2017)?  I didn't expect to like it as much as I did, but it's soundtrack is reminiscent of 1980s film and the humor keeps a light-hearted approach to an otherwise dark film.

System: Have you seen Thor: Ragnarok (2017)?  I didn't expect to like it as much as I did, but it's soundtrack is reminiscent of 1980s film and the humor keeps a light-hearted approach to an otherwise dark film.

System: Have you seen Thor: Ragnarok (2017)?  I didn't expect to like it as much as I did, but it's soundtrack is reminiscent of 1980s film and the humor keeps a light-hearted approach to an otherwise dark film.
